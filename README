Do reduced barriers to social exchange create more durable forms of inequality? We investigate this puzzle with a simple model of pairwise bargaining in populations stuck in states of inter-group inequality. This model builds on previous work suggesting populations should reach stable states of equality given infinite time. We consider the implications of both changing the proportions of interacting groups and varying the structure of interaction networks.
